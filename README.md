Dictionary Creation

In this project, the goal is to create a dictionary that is capable of searching for word meanings from a JSON file and also providing suggestions for words that may have been typed incorrectly. Then, the data from the JSON file is stored in an SQLite database, and the program is rewritten so that word searches are done through the database.

Project Steps:
User Input and Search in JSON File

The program takes a word as input from the user.
It then searches for this word in the json.data file.
If the word is found, its meanings are printed as output.
Suggest the Most Similar Word Using difflib

If the word is not found in the JSON file, the difflib module is used to find the most similar word to the user's input.
For example, if the user types the word springg, the program suggests whether the user meant spring.
If the user confirms, the meanings of the word spring are shown.
Create SQLite Database and Import Data from JSON File

An SQLite database is created.
A table named dictionary is created, which includes two columns: word (the word to be searched) and meaning (the meanings of the word).
A Python script is used to import the data from the json.data file into this table.
Rewrite the Program to Use the SQLite Database for Word Search

The program written in step 2 is rewritten so that instead of searching the json.data file, it queries the newly created SQLite database for word meanings.
